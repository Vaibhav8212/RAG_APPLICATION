# 🧠 RAG App with Hugging Face + Groq (`llama3-70b-8192`)

This is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application built using **Streamlit**, **LangChain**, **FAISS**, **HuggingFace sentence transformers**, and **Groq’s LLaMA3 model** via LangChain's `ChatGroq` wrapper.

The app lets you upload a PDF, ask questions about its content, and receive intelligent answers powered by LLMs and semantic search.

-    **Semantic Search** with Hugging Face MiniLM embeddings
-    **Vector Search** using FAISS
-    **LLM Response Generation** via Groq (`llama3-70b-8192`)
-    **Prompt Template with Context Injection**
-    **Document Viewer** for source context
- ⏱  **Response Time Display**

### Future Scope
This project has great potential for expansion and can evolve into a robust document intelligence or enterprise search platform. Here are some planned or possible enhancements:

 Dynamic PDF Upload

Replace the hardcoded PDF path with a Streamlit file uploader so users can upload their own documents directly through the UI.

 Multi-Document Support

Allow users to query across multiple uploaded PDFs or an entire folder of documents.

 RAG with Local Models

Add support for running inference on local models (e.g., via Ollama or Transformers) to reduce latency and API costs.
